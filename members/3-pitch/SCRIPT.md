# Hackathon Pitch Script - Census

## 0:00-0:30: Intro & Problem

**Opening:**
"Hey everyone! Imagine you're at a supermall. You're walking around with your friends, and you're like 'I really want Crumbl Cookie, where is that?' But the screens around you? They're just showing random ads that have nothing to do with what you actually want.

That's the problem we're solving today. Right now, digital screens in malls and stores are basically dead air - they show static ads that don't react to what people actually want in real-time. That's lost revenue for stores, and a missed opportunity to help shoppers find what they're looking for.

**The Problem:**
- Screens show irrelevant ads
- Can't react to what people are actually saying
- Dead air = lost revenue
- Shoppers can't find what they want when they want it

## 0:30-1:00: Tech Architecture (Why It's Hard)

**The Solution - Listen, Think, Act:**

Here's how Census works. It's simple in concept, but really hard to build:

**Listen:** We have voice sensors - think of them like security cameras, but they only listen for commercial words. Things like 'I want red shoes' or 'where's Crumbl Cookie?' They're not recording full conversations, just picking up these commercial signals.

**Think:** Our AI takes all these statements and chunks them together over time periods - like from 12 noon to 5pm. It analyzes what people are saying, ranks the most common wants, and figures out what ads would actually be relevant.

**Act:** Based on what the average person wants in that area, we display ads that actually matter. If a bunch of people near Auntie Anne's are saying they want Crumbl Cookie, we show them where the nearest Crumbl Cookie is.

**Why It's Hard:**
- Real-time processing of voice data
- Privacy protection - we don't record audio
- Sub-second response time
- Emergency announcements can override ads
- Semantic analysis to understand intent, not just keywords

## 1:00-2:30: The Live Demo

**Transition:**
"Alright, let's see this in action. [Lead starts the demo]"

**Narration During Demo:**
"Here you can see our live dashboard. Watch as we simulate voice inputs from shoppers in different areas of the mall.

[As events come in] See that? Someone just said they want Crumbl Cookie near the food court. Our AI is processing that in real-time.

[As more events accumulate] Now we're seeing a pattern - multiple people are asking about Crumbl Cookie in this area. The AI is ranking these requests and determining the top interests.

[As ad appears] And there it is! The screen just updated with a relevant ad showing directions to Crumbl Cookie. This all happened in under a second.

[If emergency demo] And watch this - if there's an emergency announcement, it immediately overrides any ads. Safety first.

The beauty is this is all happening in real-time, based on what people are actually saying, right now."

**If Demo Fails:**
"While we're getting that set up, let me explain what you'd be seeing: real-time voice processing, AI analysis of shopper intent, and instant ad updates based on aggregated demand patterns. This is the future of retail advertising."

## 2:30-3:00: Future & Closing

**The Vision:**
"This is just the beginning. We see Census being deployed in malls, airports, stadiums - anywhere people gather and make commercial decisions. The more people use it, the smarter it gets.

**What's Next:**
- Scale to multiple locations
- Machine learning improvements for better intent recognition
- Integration with store inventory systems
- Analytics dashboard for retailers

**Closing:**
"Census turns dead air into revenue. We listen to what people want, think about what matters, and act instantly. It's that simple. Thank you!"
